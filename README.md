# Video Streaming Cheatsheet

The *Video Streaming Cheatsheet* is a double sided page, suitable for printing, that contains common terminology used in the video streaming industry in a quick reference format.

It's written in LaTeX and the workflow generates a PDF [downloadable here](https://video-streaming-cheatsheet.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/artifacts/video-streaming-cheatsheet.pdf) for easy printing and portability.

There is a QR code in the top right of the document that links to the latest online version.

If you [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/robert_w_brown) the workflow will automatically publish a tweet when a version is updated.
